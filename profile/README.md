# 🌌 StellaX AI — The Future of Intelligent Development Environments

Welcome to **StellaX AI**, an open-source ecosystem designed to redefine how developers launch, edit, and collaborate on code — instantly and intelligently.

StellaX AI allows anyone to open a GitHub or GitLab repository directly in a browser-based VS Code environment with **zero setup**, and with **AI-powered developer tooling** built in.

> ✨ Built for speed. Powered by AI. Driven by open-source.

---

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

- **No Cloning Needed** – Load any public repo directly into a dev environment.
- **VS Code Experience in the Browser** – Fast, familiar, and fully customizable.
- **AI Co-Pilot** – Ask questions, generate code, refactor, explain – all from the editor.
- **Modular & Open** – Each part of StellaX is decoupled, open to contributions, and pluggable.
